"""Architecture/Design node: the *how* - component shape, API/schema design, data changes.

Deterministic heuristic reasoning over the clarified requirement and (when present)
the Codebase Reasoner's impact analysis - not an LLM call. Kept distinct from
Decomposer/Planner, which reasons about *what tasks, in what order*, not *how the
system should look*. No gate: this node isn't in the five-gate distribution, its
output flows straight into planning. Runs identically in live and replay mode -
only the Coder node's output is fixture-replayed.
