"""Requirement Clarifier node: parses raw intent, surfaces ambiguity, gates on greenfield.

Every gated node follows the same shape regardless of live/replay mode: it calls
`interrupt(payload)`, which pauses the graph and surfaces `payload` to whatever is
driving execution. In live mode that's a human at a terminal prompt; in replay mode
it's the scenario runner resuming with the recorded decision from the fixture via
`Command(resume=...)`. The node itself never branches on `state.mode` for this -
that's what keeps live and replay executing the identical code path.
