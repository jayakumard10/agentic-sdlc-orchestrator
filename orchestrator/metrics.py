"""Reliability metrics: success rate, retry/rollback frequency, MTTR, e2e latency.

Computed in two stages: `summarize_run` reduces one completed `GraphState`'s audit
trail into a `RunSummary`; `compute_metrics` aggregates a list of `RunSummary`
objects (one or more runs, e.g. the three captured scenarios) into `RunMetrics`.
Kept independent of persistence — callers load whatever `GraphState`s they have
(from the Postgres checkpointer or from a saved fixture) and pass them in.
